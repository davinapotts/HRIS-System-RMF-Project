### **Project Purpose**

This project simulates the role of an Information Systems Security Officer supporting authorization of a Moderate impact SaaS Human Resources Information System operating within a civilian federal enterprise environment.

The objective is to demonstrate practical application of the NIST Risk Management Framework across the system lifecycle, from categorization through continuous monitoring. 

### **Organizational Context**

ABC Company, is a fictional civilian federal entity seeking to modernize their legacy human resources platform through implementation of a SaaS-based HRIS. 

The system supports personnel records management, payroll coordination, benefits administration, and workforce data reporting. The environment processes Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and supports mission-enabling administrative operations. 

Due to the sensitivity of the data and business reliance on system confidentiality, integrity, and availability, the system is categorized as Moderate impact in accordance with FIPS 199.

### **Security Categorization**

- Confidentiality: Moderate

- Integrity: Moderate

- Availability: Moderate

### **Categorization rationale includes:**

- Storage and processing of employee PII

- Integrity requirements for payroll and personnel records

- Operational disruption risk if system availability is degraded

### **RMF Lifecycle Phases Demonstrated**

- Prepare

- Categorize

- Select

- Implement

- Assess

- Authorize

- Monitor

Each phase includes structured documentation artifacts aligned to NIST SP 800-37 and NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5.

### **Key Artifacts Included**

- System description and boundary definition
- Data flow and architectural diagrams
- FIPS 199 categorization analysis
- Control baseline selection and tailoring rationale
- Sample SSP control implementation statements
- Risk register with inherent and residual risk scoring
- POA&M entries with remediation tracking
- Continuous monitoring strategy and reporting framework
